Horde zla burned cars, nearly blew up a gas station and demolished shops while \u0160kripari and residents of \u0160iroki Brijeg stoned visiting fan's buses and shot at them with firearms. Horde Zla also claim multiple counts of severe police brutality which led to the death of Horde zla member Vedran Pulji\u0107 from police inflicted gunshot wounds. There are conflicting reports about who started the violence. Horde zla accused local residents and police of mistreatment on their way to the match, saying that the incident was planned by local politicians and that their buses were separated and parked too far from the stadium which left them open to stoning and attacks. They also claim that initially there were only 30 local policemen present, and they did nothing to prevent the violence.  Local police and residents said Horde Zla fans were the first to attack. A local policeman, Oliver Knezovi\u0107, accused of murdering Pulji\u0107, fled to Zagreb, Croatia from where he could not be extradited to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as there is no agreement on this issue between the two countries."

The bullet that killed Reeves was recovered from the bedroom ceiling, and the spent shell casing was found under his body.  While there was no sign of forced entry, two additional bullets were discovered embedded in the bedroom floor.  All three bullets had been fired from the weapon found at his feet (though all witnesses agreed they heard only one gunshot).  Despite the unanswered questions, Reeves' death was officially ruled a suicide, based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the autopsy report.  "

The medical evidence was that \"[a] gunshot wound which penetrates in a body cavity, the abdominal cavity or the thoracic cavity is very likely to produce a profound reflex shock reaction, that is quite different from a gunshot wound which penetrates only skin and muscle and it is not at all uncommon for a person shot in the abdomen to lose consciousness and go into this reflex shock condition for short periods of time up to half an hour or so.\" But the reflexive activity or unconsciousness need not cause physical collapse: it can exist where the subject physically acts in fact, but is not at the time conscious of acting (cf some European continental jurisdictions classify conduct resulting from automatism under the rubric of unconsciousness). In R. v. Cogdon (1950) unreported but noted in Morris, Somnambulistic Homicide: Ghosts, Spiders and North Koreans (1951) 5 Res Judicatae 29,  the defendant struck her daughter on the head with an axe while sleepwalking and dreaming about North Koreans. Her movements were not voluntary, so she was acquitted.

PTSD can be diagnosed after a person experiences one or more intense and traumatic events and react with fear with complaints from three categorical symptoms lasting one month or longer. These categories are: re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoiding anything associated with the trauma, and increased symptoms of increased psychological arousal (Bellis, M.D. p. 555). "

Stopping at the food pickup window, Flores noticed shattered windows and the sound of gunfire, before \"looking up and there he was, just shooting\". Flores reversed her car until she crashed into a fence; she hid with her two-year-old daughter until the shooting ended. Three 11-year-old boys rode their bikes into the west parking lot to purchase soft drinks. Hearing a member of the public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omar Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head and died. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty noted an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking toward the entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head."
