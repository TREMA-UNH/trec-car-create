It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better data recording leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a  date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology."

Radiocarbon dating of samples on either side of the Aller\u00f8d\u2013Younger Dryas Boundary yielded dates that exhibited a very rapid age shift. Typically, they jump from 11,000 radiocarbon years BP to 10,700\u201310,600 radiocarbon years BP at the boundary. The 11,000 radiocarbon years BP dates clearly pre-dates the boundary. The first (oldest) overlying Younger Dryas radiocarbon samples often yielded ages of 10,700\u201310,600 radiocarbon years BP without any evidence of either an intervening unconformity or other evidence of erosion or nondeposition. Radiocarbon dates of terrestrial macrofossils and tree rings in Europe show that this decline in apparent radiocarbon age occurred over about a 50-year period. For the Younger Dryas\u2013Preboreal transition, high-resolution dating of identified plant macrofossils yielded dates that fall within so-called radiocarbon plateau, i.e., a 200- to 250-year-long period when radiocarbon dating yields dates that are all roughly the same. As a result, the end of Younger Dryas can at best can only be estimated to have occurred sometime about 10,000\u201310,050 radiocarbon years BP."

This is done by calibration curves, which convert a measurement of  in a sample into an estimated calendar age.  The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the \"radiocarbon age\", which is the age in \"radiocarbon years\" of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used \u2212 the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the / ratio has not changed over time.  Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for , which for more than a decade after Libby's initial work was thought to be 5,568 years.  This was revised in the early 1960s to 5,730 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%).  For consistency with these early papers, and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life, radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value.  A correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves, so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect, the final reported calibrated date, in calendar years, is accurate.  When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of  in the atmosphere over time."

This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their  replenished and instead start losing  through decay.  Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in.  Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of N (the number of atoms of  remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of N \u2013 the number of atoms of  in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed \u2013 and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time. Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the / ratio.

In places where the calibration curve is steep, and does not change direction, as in example t in blue on the graph to the right, the resulting calendar year range is quite narrow.  Where the curve varies significantly both up and down, a single radiocarbon date range may produce two or more separate calendar year ranges.  Example t, in red on the graph, shows this situation: a radiocarbon age range of about 1260 BP to 1280 BP converts to three separate ranges between about 1190 BP and 1260 BP.  A third possibility is that the curve is flat for some range of calendar dates; in this case, illustrated by t, in green on the graph, a range of about 30 radiocarbon years, from 1180 BP to 1210 BP, results in a calendar year range of about a century, from 1080 BP to 1180 BP."

Shinn in 1977 from the Bimini Road. In 1979, Calvert and others reported dates of 2780\u00b170  yr BP (UM-1359), 3500\u00b180  yr BP (UM-1360), and 3350\u00b190  yr BP (UM-1361) from whole-rock samples; a date of 3510\u00b170  yr BP (UM-1362), from shells extracted from the beachrock core; and dates of 2770\u00b180  yr BP (UM-1364) and 2840\u00b170  yr BP (UM-1365) from carbonate cementing the beachrock core. These dates are temporally consistent in that the shells composing the beachrock core from the Bimini Road dated older than the cement holding them together as beachrock. These dates can be interpreted as indicating that the shells composing the Bimini Road are, uncorrected for temporal and environmental variations in radiocarbon, about 3,500 years old. Because of time-averaging and other taphonomic factors, a random collection of shells likely would yield a radiocarbon date that is a few hundred years earlier than when the final accumulation of shells, which were cemented to form beachrock, actually occurred. The radiocarbon dates from the cement demonstrate that the beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed about 2,800 radiocarbon years ago by the cementation of pre-existing sediments that accumulated about 1,300 years earlier. Compared to the dates from the shells and the cement, it appears that the whole-rock dates reflect samples containing varying proportions of shell and cement without any significant contamination by younger radiocarbon. Both these dates and interpretation are consistent with the detailed research by Davaud and Strasser that concluded that the layer of beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed beneath the surface of North Bimini Island and was only exposed by coastal erosion about 1,900 to 2,000 years ago."

This \"wiggle-matching\" technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates.  Since the data points on the calibration curve are five years or more apart, and since at least five points are required for a match, there must be at least a 25-year span of tree ring (or similar) data for this match to be possible. Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce.

They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30\u00d7) stereomicroscope, as well as under high magnification (320\u00d7) viewed through both transmitted light and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found \"only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers\" and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material."
