However, in a precedent determining decision, the magistrate judge determined that Bitcoin is money, and thus the investments were securities.  The magistrate judge stated, \u201c[i]t is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.\u201d This decision paved the way for other regulators to treat Bitcoin and VCs as money, so it is likely this decision will be cited if regulators decide to prosecute VC transactions under the UIGEA, Illegal Gambling Business Act, Wire Act, or any other regulation involving financial transactions."

The company bitlaunder.com claims they are \u201cexperts at laundering Bitcoin\u201d and they \u201cuse the most sophisticated methods available to completely anonymize your Bitcoins and obscure their history from forensic tracing.\u201d  The Government Accountability Office reported that the pseudonymity in VCs makes it difficult for the government to detect money laundering and other financial crimes, and it may be necessary to rely on international cooperation to address these crimes. Similarly, the European Banking Authority, claimed that regulations should strive for \u201cglobal, coordination, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve a successful regulatory regime.\u201d  In spite of the best regulations from the United States and the European Union, the inherent nature of the Bitcoin protocol allows for pseudonymous transfers of Bitcoins to or from anywhere in the world, so illegal transactions will not be completely eliminated through regulations.  Anonymity in Bitcoins and Altcoins (forks from the Bitcoin protocol) can be increased by adding software augmentations to the VC. Zerocoin, for example, uses an algorithmic process called \u201czero-knowledge proof\u201d to hide the value of the coins. Dark Wallet anonymously combines transfers of VC to obscure the origin of the transfer, and the developers intend to integrate the software into a Tor network in the future. One of the developers of Dark Wallet described it as \u201cjust money laundering software.\u201d  He said, \u201cI want a private means for black market transactions,\u201d \u201cwhether they\u2019re for non-prescribed medical inhalers, MDMA for drug enthusiasts, or weapons.\u201d A crypto-currency known as Darkcoin offers even more anonymity than Bitcoin.  Similar to Dark Wallet, Darkcoin combines transactions to increase the difficulty of analyzing where the currency was sent. \u201cSome users may be trading Bitcoins for Darkcoins and back again, using the Darkcoin network as a giant bitcoin-laundering service.\u201dOther forms of VC have also been used for making illegal transactions.  The VC service and exchange Liberty Reserve allegedly laundered over 6 billions dollars from crimes such as and \u201ccredit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking.\u201d   E-gold, a company with a VC tied to the value of gold, pleaded guilty to money laundering and running an unlicensed money transmitting business, and consequently had to forfeit $45,816,817.84 to the government."

One of the largest problems that Bitcoin has is that Bitcoin is not widely accepted; users want to use it have to exchange for fiat currencies. ANX has basically eliminated the problem with its Bitcoin debit card that allows users to use Bitcoins within the traditional credit card payment system. Users can reload funds to the debit cards using Bitcoin. The card can be used for both online and Point of Sale purchases as well as withdrawals through the Global AT&T Network, in other words, they can easily spend their bitcoins at many locations that take traditional debit cards."

In April 2011, the FBI indicted the \u201cfounders of the three largest Internet poker companies doing business in the United States\u2014PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker . . . with bank fraud, money laundering, and illegal gambling offenses.\u201d  In 2006, the United States enacted the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), yet the poker companies continued to operate until the 2011 indictment. Similar to the 2011 indictment, the Justice Department may be collecting evidence and building a case against the Bitcoin gambling sites before they launch an indictment. The UIGEA does not expressly prohibit Internet gambling, but it does make it illegal for an online gambling business to knowingly accept fund transfers.   The Bitcoin gambling sites are currently circumventing this legislation by keeping their funds in Bitcoin wallets.  However, in order for these sites to exchange their Bitcoins for a fiat currency they must use a financial exchange, so even by receiving their earnings with Bitcoin, the online gambling sites may come into jurisdiction of the UIGEA if the gambling business accepts payment through \u201c(i) automated clearing house (ACH) systems, (ii) card systems, (iii) check collection systems, (iv) money transmitting businesses, and (v) wire transfer systems.\u201dThe Illegal Gambling Business Act may also prohibit Bitcoin gambling sites because the act broadly prohibits all gambling businesses that are in (i) \u201cviolation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted;(ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and(iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day.\u201d  Under IRS regulations Bitcoin and other VCs are treated as property, so losses and gains must be calculated to determine the value of the virtual currency.  If an online gambling business earned the value of at least $2,000 dollars in Bitcoin \u201cin any single day\u201d, they may fall under this act.  The Federal Wire Act (Wire Act) prohibits \u201cbets or wagers on any sporting event or contest.\u201d Some Bitcoin gambling sites have a mixture of betting on sports and traditional casino games, and it is conceivable the bets on sporting events could fall within the language of the Wire Act. The Wire Act expressly mentions \u201cmoney or credit as a result of bets or wagers,\u201d and VCs may fall under the intent of the Wire Act because they operate as credits that can be redeemed or exchanged at VC exchanges, and they operate like money because they facilitate transactions."

The proof-of-stake method of generating coins requires very minimal energy consumption; it only requires the energy to run the client software on a computer, as opposed to running resource-intensive cryptographic hashing functions. During its early stages of growth, most Peercoins will be generated by proof-of-work like bitcoin, however over time proof-of-work will be phased out as proof-of-work difficulty increases and block rewards decrease. As Proof-of-stake  becomes the primary source of coin generation, energy consumption (relative to market cap) decreases over time. As of January 2014, roughly 90% of new coins being generated are still from proof-of-work and the energy consumption of Peercoin uses roughly 30% of the energy consumption of bitcoin (scaling for market cap - in terms of value secured per GH/s)."

Bitcoin prices dropped by over 50% but bottomed out above $200 through 2014.  He raised concerns about Bitcoin, including it being a high-risk virtual commodity, lack of consumer protection, having an artificially inflated price, extreme hoarding, hyped demand, high potential for market manipulation, and need for strong regulation. On April 2, 2014, Williams provided congressional testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business discussing the 10 major risks associated with Bitcoin. On October 21, 2014 he presented on virtual currencies at The World Bank and on April 23, 2015 at the Bretton Woods Committee. The Bitcoin community remains critical of his concerns.

Second, Great Southern Group's rapid expansion had been underpinned by high levels of debt, and in difficult economic circumstances in which new investment was diminishing and new borrowings were hard to obtain, that debt could not successfully be serviced. Third, some experts and Great Southern Group itself expressed concern that investor uncertainty caused by ATO rulings, and fueled by reporting of taxation policy issues, had scared investors away from their MIS. This was a view that the Australian Taxation Office rejected, arguing that the administrators of both Timbercorp and Great Southern had not identified taxation uncertainty as an issue. Finally, a range of commentators considered that the MIS tax concessions were encouraging unsustainable business models, with companies focusing on selling the tax benefits of investments rather than focussing on profitable commodity production. This, it was argued, led them to underestimate business risks, overinflate land prices, and sell products at lower-than-optimal prices. The failure of MIS schemes for these reasons was predicted in 2008 by Ajani, who argued that \"we know that investment driven by the demand for tax minimisation, and not market realities, is associated with collapse\"."
