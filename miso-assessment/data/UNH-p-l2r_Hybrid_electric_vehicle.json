If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around  due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid-electrics. General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method to take into account the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel  on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight."

This could reduce a country's dependence upon imported petroleum fuels and enable cleaner power sources such as wind or solar to help fuel our vehicles in the future.
