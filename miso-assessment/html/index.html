<h2> Training </h2>

<p>The following topics were selected for the training session.</p>

<p>Please be rather strict with your assessment. If you would prefer to not read a paragraph on the article, please marke it as "remove".</p>
<p>If you don't find that the paragraph pertains to any of the provided facets, this is a strong sign that the paragraph should be marked as 'remove'. In doubt, double check with the gold article. If you still find that the paragraph is central to the topic, please mark it as 'OTHER RELEVANT FACET'.  </p>
<p>If a paragraphs contains very general content, i.e., too general to assign it to one particular facet, this paragraph can be marked as 'GENERAL/INTRODUCTION'. Sometimes general paragraphs are too short to take any meaningful information away, these should be marked as 'remove'.</p>
<p>The default facet relevance assessment should be 'SHOULD' be mentioned. Use 'CAN' for borderline assessments and 'MUST', for excellent information.</p>
<p>For transition assessments, the default assessment is 'COHERENT'. Use 'SAME TOPIC' only for paragraphs that discuss the same sub-aspect and must therefore occur together. Use 'TOPIC SWITCH' for unpleasant transitions or major topical shifts. (We expect every generated page to contain at least two major shifts.)</p>

<p> Assessments are stored in the your browser. You will find as you navigate to the second run of a topic, that some assessments have already been set. This means you already assessed the relevance of this paragraph (and possibly transition). If you change the assessment, the change will automatically propagate to other runs. </p>
<p> As these assessments are only stored in the browser: <b>Don't forget to click on 'UPLOAD' after finishing a topic.</b> You find the button at top right of assessment page. You will receive a confirmation on upon successful upload. In the case of emergency: please select 'Show Assessment Data' and copy/paste the text into a file. </p>
<p> Every assessor has its own local brower cache for assessments. Just please make sure to logout of the session using the link above. (And double check that the right user is being tracked.)</p>
