However, when S. cerevisiae is grown on glucose in aerobic conditions, respiration-related gene expression is repressed.  Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins expression is only induced under environmental stress conditions, specifically low glucose availability.  Genes involving mitochondrial energy generation and phosphorylation oxidation, which are involved in respiration, have the largest expression difference between aerobic fermentative yeast species and respiratory species.  In a comparative analysis between Sch. pombe and S. cerevisiae, both of which evolved aerobic fermentation independently, the expression pattern of these two fermentative yeasts were more similar to each other than a respiratory yeast, C. albicans.  However, S. cerevisiae is evolutionarily closer to C. albicans.  Regulatory rewiring was likely important in the evolution of aerobic fermentation in both lineages."

ATP production in these cancer cells is often only through the process of glycolysis and pyruvate is broken down by the fermentation process in the cell's cytoplasm.  This phenomenon is often seen as counterintuitive, since cancer cells have higher energy demands due to the continued proliferation and respiration produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis alone (fermentation produces no additional ATP).  Typically, there is an up-regulation in glucose transporters and enzymes in the glycolysis pathway (also seen in yeast).  There are many parallel aspects of aerobic fermentation in tumor cells that are also seen in Crabtree-positive yeasts. Further research into the evolution of aerobic fermentation in yeast such as S. cerevisiae can be a useful model for understanding aerobic fermentation in tumor cells.  This has a potential for better understanding cancer and cancer treatments."

Several potential causes for the decline in fermentative activity have been investigated. Viability remained at or above 90%, internal pH remained near neutrality, and the specific activities of the glycolytic and alcohologenic enzymes (measured in vitro) remained high throughout batch fermentation. None of these factors appears to be causally related to the fall in fermentative activity during batch fermentation."

Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, have played a significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water.  During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity.  Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species.  Introgression and HGT is common in Saccharomyces domesticated strains.  Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-Saccharomyces species.  HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.  For example, the important industrial yeast strain "

Adh2 catalyzes the reverse reaction, consuming ethanol and converting it to acetaldehyde.  The ancestral, or original, Adh had a similar function as Adh1 and after a duplication in this gene, Adh2 evolved a lower K for ethanol.  Adh2 is believed to have increased yeast species' tolerance for ethanol and allowed Crabtree-positive species to consume the ethanol they produced after depleting sugars.

These fruit provided an abundance of simple sugar food source for microbial communities, including both yeast and bacteria.  Bacteria, at that time, were able to produce biomass at a faster rate than the yeast.  Producing a toxic compound, like ethanol, can slow the growth of bacteria, allowing the yeast to be more competitive.  However, the yeast still had to use a portion of the sugar it consumes to produce ethanol.  Crabtree-positive yeasts also have increased glycolytic flow, or increased uptake of glucose and conversion to pyruvate, which compensates for using a portion of the glucose to produce ethanol rather than biomass.  Therefore, it is believed that the original driving force was to kill competitors.  This is supported by research that determined the kinetic behavior of the ancestral ADH protein, which was found to be optimized to make ethanol, rather than consume it."

Ethanol is a main cause of low cell yield. Aerobic ethanol formation in the presence of glucose concentration is known as glucose effect or Crabtree effect. To reduce this effect, a fed-batch process is generally employed for baker's yeast production. In aerobic cultures of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, organic acids such as acetic acid, (and in lesser amounts, lactic acid and formic acid), are produced as byproducts when sugar concentration is high, and these acids inhibit cell growth as well as show deteriorating effect on the metabolic activities. The formation of these acids are called bacterial Crabtree effects."
