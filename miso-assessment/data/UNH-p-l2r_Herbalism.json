Currently acupuncturists in NSW are bound by the guidelines in the Public Health (Skin Penetration) Regulation 2000 which is enforced at local council level.  In 2012 the CMBV became the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia, and in 2013 established an interim accreditation standard for the profession in partnership with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.  The legislation put in place stipulates that only practitioners who are state-registered may use the following titles: Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Registered Acupuncturist, Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioner, and Registered Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioner."

When Chinese herbal tea becomes more popular, the demand is way higher than the supply .It is because producing a Chinese herbal tea needs couples of hours. Obviously, it cannot fulfill the demand of the market immediately. This way of producing Chinese herbal tea needs a change, in an advance way. After that, Wang Zebang has a new idea to sell Chinese herbal tea. He decided to design packets of herbal tea bag. Customers can buy the herbal tea bag and boil it by themselves.

Elizabeth had great interest in gardening and from there she sought to learn more about herbals through gardening books. It was uncommon to see women during this era attend schools to obtain an education, but elite women did have an opportunity to learn Latin with tutors at home. However, Elizabeth took a different route in her leaning in that she went on to pursue learning more about herbals rather than Latin. She also attempted to learn French to acclimate with the women of the London society, but never completed her lessons. Elizabeth\u2019s familial inheritance of females who already had medical knowledge, gave her the \u201cauthoritative background\u201d necessary to pursue her interest in herbalism. Herbalism might have also been a part of Elizabeth\u2019s religious life as another part of her \u201creligious calling/duty\u201d to help others. Elizabeth interpreted that \u201csurrounding all is Christ\u2019s example providing \u2018the way.\u2019\u201d Being a very religious individual, she found a voice through God that this is her calling in life.
