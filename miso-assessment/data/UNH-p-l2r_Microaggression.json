The artist, Radcliffe Bailey, is \"a descendant of former slaves and Civil War soldiers who fought for the North\" (Jackson, Cadance). Bailey's work is known to use themes and concepts from his own life and his family's history of involvement in ending slavery (Jackson, Cadance). The piece \"recalls the infancy of anthropological and ethnological studies during the nineteenth century\" where scientist such as Samuel G. Morton used \"human skulls as evidence to support theories of racial hierarchies\" (Wolf, Alana). Skulls like the heads in the cabinet were used in scientific attempts to justify racism and slavery. The heads deny this concept of scientific racism \"by simultaneously bearing distinctive... African facial features associated with blackness while [also being] cast in a bright white finish\" (Wolf, Alana). Rankine places an image of the cabinet in chapter six of Citizen following the Mark Duggan excerpt on page 119. Rankine used Bailey's piece because it reminded her of a line in Citizen that states \"the past has \u2018turned [our] flesh into its own cupboards\u2019\" (Believermag). Rankine is relating the black body to the wooden cabinet in Bailey's art piece. Through the image, Rankine points out that African Americans \"have had to hold the history of this violence,\" slavery, and racism \"in our bodies for centuries\" just as the heads in the image have likewise been preserved on the shelves of the cabinet for centuries and used in support of racism, slavery, and violence (Believermag). Rankine also relates the placement of the heads to \"the way bodies are stacked on top of one another in slave ships\" (Believermag). She believes that \"the heads are speaking to each other, almost as if they are asking the question, \u2018Did he just say that?\u2019 \u2018Did I just hear what I think I heard?\u2019\" (Believermag). These questions refer to responses made by Rankine throughout Citizen after instances of microaggressions. The way in which both the black body and the heads hold a history of racism and question instances of microaggressions supports Rankine's purpose of relating the history of slavery and racism to the present form of racism in the form of microaggressions."

Rankine prescribes melancholia with an overall sense of exhaustion that leads the reader directly into a very familiar place: \"bed\". It is here, in the beginning of the book that Rankine masterfully weaves \"prose, poetry and visual image pervasively into the daily American social and cultural life, subtly foreshadowing and boding its readers to the challenges certain citizens must overcome in order to not become invisible (National Book Award Judges\u2019 Citation).\" \"Sometimes the moon is missing and beyond the windows the low, gray ceiling seems approachable. Its dark light dims in degrees depending on the density of clouds and you fall back into that which gets reconstructed as metaphor.\" (Citizen, pg.1) Moreover, Rankine's first paragraph offers the oppressed citizens, Blacks, a subtle solution even before delivering her readers the very contents of her book. The book is lyrically written, in of itself, as an extended metaphor of the extreme color distinction between white and black. Only people's perspectives regarding race allows society to identify the difference when regarding humanity and therefore equality. Throughout the lyric this racial divergence becomes more apparent as Rankine conveys each experience. The crux of the metaphor is the subsiding factor of grey; a color degree between that of white and black that implies patience and hope. These factors, subtly and metaphorically penned in the first paragraph grants these citizens a means to press forward against the subtle microaggressions, which, metaphorically speaking, is a wake for them in the very wake of the book. \"There are billions of souls in the world and some of us are almost to be touching the depths of how it is and what it is to be human. On the surface we exist but just beyond is existence. I write to articulate that felt experience.\"(Rankine)\t\t\tThe first chapter immediately transfers the reader into a black persona who is quickly becoming invisible by the harassment of microaggressions. The necessity of tolerance ascribed by blacks, that is, in these occurrences even are subjected to children in grade school. Still consistent with second person perspective use of you, the short narration is of a child: \"You\", who experiences a microaggression by first a student who is copying her work throughout the school year, and secondly, from Sister Evelyn, who never acknowledges the blatant incidences. \"...later when she tells you you smell good and have features more like a white person. You assume she thinks she is thanking you for letting her cheat and feels better cheating from an almost white person.\" The microaggression described here is that, you are unworthy of a genuine acknowledgment of gratitude. \"Thank you\", is unnecessary or does not apply because you are classified as an \"almost\" in girl students\u2019 mind. Rankine's verbiage utilizing the word assume, remarks the harsh reality that you have to ascribe an excuse or reasoning for another's actions. You must enable them - her and therefore the situation, crippling it, in order to rectify your own stability, in your own personal defense, so that you do not take direct offense. Only because the offense was not a direct form of prejudice. \"Sister Evelyn never figures out your arrangement perhaps because you never turn around to copy Mary Catherine's answers. Sister Evelyn must think these two girls think a lot alike or she cares less about cheating and more about humiliation or she never actually saw you sitting there.\""
