Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. (\"Although daylight saving time is considered correct, daylight savings time (with an \"s\") is commonly used.\") The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving[s] time). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving (without \"time\"), daylight savings (without \"time\"), and daylight time.<ref>Daylight saving time and its variants:"
